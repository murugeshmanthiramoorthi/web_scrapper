''that same year , downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played james spader 's character 's sidekick in tuff turf and then a bully in john hughes 's weird science .he was considered for the role of duckie in john hughes 's film pretty in pink ( ) , but his first lead role was with molly ringwald in the pick-up artist ( ) .because of these and other coming-of-age films downey did during the s , he is sometimes named as a member of the brat pack .in , downey played julian wells , a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control , in the film version of the bret easton ellis novel less than zero .his performance , described by janet maslin in the new york times as `` desperately moving '' , was widely praised , though downey has said that for him `` the role was like the ghost of christmas future '' since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an `` exaggeration of the character '' in real life .zero drove downey into films with bigger budgets and names , such as chances are ( ) with cybill shepherd and ryan o'neal , air america ( ) with mel gibson , and soapdish ( ) with sally field , kevin kline , and whoopi goldberg .in , he starred as charlie chaplin in chaplin , a role for which he prepared extensively , learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed .he had a personal coach in order to help him imitate chaplin 's posture , and a way of carrying himself .the role garnered downey an academy award nomination for best actor at the academy awards th ceremony , losing to al pacino in scent of a woman .in , he appeared in the films heart and souls with alfre woodard and kyra sedgwick and short cuts with matthew modine and julianne moore , along with a documentary that he wrote about the presidential campaigns titled the last party ( ) .he starred in the films , only you with marisa tomei , and natural born killers with woody harrelson .he then subsequently appeared in restoration ( ) , richard iii ( ) , two girls and a guy ( ) , as special agent john royce in u.s. marshals ( ) , and in black and white ( ) .from through , downey was arrested numerous times on charges related to drugs including cocaine , heroin , and marijuana and went through drug treatment programs unsuccessfully , explaining in to a judge : `` it 's like i have a shotgun in my mouth , and i 've got my finger on the trigger , and i like the taste of the gun metal .

''in a december , article for people magazine entitled `` bad to worse '' , downey 's stepmother rosemary told author alex tresnlowski , that downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder `` a few years ago '' and added that his bipolar disorder was `` the reason he has a hard time staying sober .what has n't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy '' .in the same article , dr. manijeh nikakhtar , a los angeles psychiatrist and co-author of addiction or self-medication : the truth , claimed she received a letter from downey in , during his time at corcoran ii , asking for advice on his condition .she discovered that `` no one had done a complete [ psychiatric ] evaluation [ on him ] ... i asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar , and he said , 'oh yeah .there are times i spend a lot of money and i 'm hyperactive , and there are other times i 'm down . ' ''in an article for the march issue of esquire , downey stated that he wanted to address `` this whole thing about the bipolar '' after receiving a phone call from `` the bipolar association '' asking him about being bipolar .when downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar , the caller quoted the people article , to which downey replied , `` 'no !dr. malibusian said [ i said i was bipolar ] ... ' , and they go , 'well , it 's been written , so we 're going to quote it . ' ''downey flatly denied being `` depressed or manic '' and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because `` the guy i was seeing did n't know i was smokin ' crack in his bathroom .you ca n't make a diagnosis until somebody 's sober . ''after five years of substance abuse , arrests , rehab , and relapse , downey was ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and return to his career .in discussing his failed attempts to control his addictive behavior in the past , downey told oprah winfrey in november that `` when someone says , ' i really wonder if maybe i should go to rehab ? 'well , uh , you 're a wreck , you just lost your job , and your wife left you .uh , you might want to give it a shot . ''he added that after his last arrest in april , when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab , `` i said , 'you know what ?i do n't think i can continue doing this . 'and i reached out for help , and i ran with it .you can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you 'll get it and you wo n't take advantage of it .it 's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems ... what 's hard is to decide to do it . ''downey got his first post-rehabilitation acting job in august , lip-syncing in the video for elton john 's single `` i want love '' .video director sam taylor-wood shot takes of the video and used the last one because , according to john , downey looked completely relaxed and `` the way he underplays it is fantastic '' .downey was able to return to the big screen after mel gibson , who had been a close friend to downey since both had co-starred in air america , paid downey 's insurance bond for the film the singing detective ( directed by his back to school co-star keith gordon ) .gibson 's gamble paved the way for downey 's comeback and downey returned to mainstream films in the mid- s with gothika , for which producer joel silver withheld % of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior .similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since .silver , who was getting closer to downey as he dated his assistant susan levin , also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller kiss kiss bang bang , the directorial debut of screenwriter shane black .after gothika , downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles , including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films : a guide to recognizing your saints , good night , and good luck , richard linklater 's dystopian , rotoscoped a scanner darkly ( in which downey plays the role of a drug addict ) , and steven shainberg 's fictional biographical film of diane arbus , fur , where downey 's character represented the two biggest influences on arbus 's professional life , lisette model and marvin israel .downey also received great notice for his roles in more mainstream fare such as kiss kiss bang bang and disney 's poorly received the shaggy dog .on november , , downey released his debut musical album , the futurist , on sony classical , for which he designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the cd with his son indio .the album received mixed reviews , but downey stated in that he probably will not do another album , as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated .in , downey returned to television when he did voice acting on family guy in the episode `` the fat guy strangler '' .downey had previously telephoned the show 's production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation , as his son indio is a fan of the show .the producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of patrick pewterschmidt , lois griffin 's long lost , mentally disturbed brother , for downey .downey signed on with publishers harpercollins to write a memoir , which in , was already being billed as a `` candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career '' .in , however , downey returned his advance to the publishers , and canceled the book without further comment .in , downey appeared in david fincher 's mystery thriller zodiac , which was based on a true story .he played the role of san francisco chronicle journalist paul avery , who was reporting the zodiac killer case .with all of the critical success downey had experienced throughout his career , he had not appeared in a `` blockbuster '' film .that changed in when downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films , iron man and tropic thunder .in the article ben stiller wrote for downey 's entry in the edition of the time , he offered an observation on downey 's commercially successful summer at the box office : yes , downey is iron man , but he really is actor man ... in the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king , the realm that actually means something , he has always ruled , and finally this summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex , where his mastery is in full effect .in , downey was cast as the title character in the film iron man , with director jon favreau explaining the choice by stating : `` downey was n't the most obvious choice , but he understood what makes the character tick .he found a lot of his own life experience in 'tony stark ' . ''favreau insisted on having downey as he repeatedly claimed that downey would be to iron man what johnny depp is to the pirates of the caribbean series : a lead actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public 's interest in it .for the role downey had to gain more than pounds ( kilograms ) of muscle in five months to look like he `` had the power to forge iron '' .iron man was globally released between april and may , , grossing over $ million worldwide and receiving rave reviews which cited downey 's performance as a highlight of the film .by october , downey had agreed to appear as iron man in two iron man sequels , as part of the iron man franchise , as well as the avengers , featuring the superhero team that stark joins , based on marvel 's comic book series the avengers .he first reprised the role in a small appearance as iron man 's alter ego tony stark in the film the incredible hulk , as a part of marvel studios ' depicting the same marvel universe on film by providing continuity among the movies .after iron man , downey appeared alongside ben stiller and jack black in the stiller-directed tropic thunder .the three actors play a hollywood archetype‚Äîwith downey playing self-absorbed multi-oscar-winning australian method actor kirk lazarus‚Äîas they star in an extremely expensive vietnam-era film called tropic thunder .lazarus undergoes a `` controversial skin pigmentation procedure '' in order to take on the role of african-american platoon sergeant lincoln osiris , which required downey to wear dark makeup and a wig .both stiller and downey feared downey 's portrayal of the character could become controversial : stiller says that he and downey always stayed focused on the fact that they were skewering insufferable actors , not african americans .`` i was trying to push it as far as you can within reality '' , stiller explains .`` i had no idea how people would respond to it '' .stiller screened a rough cut of the film [ in march ] and it scored high with african americans .he was relieved at the reaction .`` it seems people really embrace it '' , he said .when asked by harry smith on cbs 's the early show who his model was for lazarus , downey laughed before responding , `` sadly , my sorry-ass self .
